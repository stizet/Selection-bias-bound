Description: Calculates two different bounds for the selection bias for binary
    variables in the extended M structure and a bound for observed binary data.
    For the M structure, Smith and VanderWeeles and the assumption free bound,
    are calculated based on user input parameters. For the data, the assumption
    free bound is calculated with the data as input.
