# Introduction

Selecting a study population from a larger source population, based on the
research question, is a common procedure, for example in an observational study
with data from a population register. Subjects who fulfill all the selection
criteria are included in the study population, and subjects who do not fulfill
at least one selection criterion are excluded from the study population. These
selections might introduce a systematic error when estimating a causal effect,
commonly referred to as selection bias. Selection bias can also arise if the
selections are involuntary, for example, if there are dropouts or other missing
values for some individuals in the study. In an applied study, it is often of
interest to assess the magnitude of potential biases using a sensitivity
analysis, such as bounding the bias. Different bounds, the SV (Smith and
VanderWeele), AF (assumption-free), GAF (generalized assumption-free), and CAF 
(counterfactual assumption-free), for the causal estimand under selection bias
can be calculated in this R package `SelectionBias`. The content is:

* `zika_learner`: a simulated dataset of zika virus and microcephaly inspired
both by data and a previous example [@de2018association;@smith2019bounding]. 
* `sensitivityparametersM()`: a function that calculates the sensitivity
parameters for the SV and GAF bounds for an assumed model following the
M-structure in Figure 1. 
* `SVbound()`: a function that calculates the SV bound for the relative risk or
risk difference in either the total or subpopulation for sensitivity parameters
given by the user, or calculated from `sensitivityparametersM()`.
* `AFbound()`: a function that calculates the AF lower and upper bounds for the
relative risk or risk difference in either the total or subpopulation for a
dataset or probabilities from the data.
* `GAFbound()`: a function that calculates the GAF lower and upper bounds for
the relative risk or risk difference in either the total or subpopulation for a
dataset or probabilities from the data and sensitivity parameters either given
by the user, or calculated from `sensitivityparametersM()`.
* `CAFbound()`: a function that calculates the CAF lower and upper bounds for
the relative risk or risk difference in either the total or subpopulation for a
dataset or probabilities from the data and sensitivity parameters.
* `SVboundsharp()`: a function that evaluates if the SV bound for the
subpopulation is sharp, inconclusive or not sharp.

For the formulas of the bounds as well as the theory behind them, we refer to
the original papers [@smith2019bounding;@zetterstrom2022selection;@zetterstrom2023Rpackage;@zetterstrom2024].

# R package

## Simulated zika dataset

To illustrate the bounds, a simulated dataset, `zika_learner`, is constructed.
It is inspired by a numerical zika example used in @smith2019bounding together
with a case-control study that investigates the effect of zika virus on
microcephaly [@de2018association]. The variables included are: 

* *Living area* $(V)$
* *Socioeconomic status, SES* $(U)$
* *Zika* $(T)$
* *Microcephaly* $(Y)$
* *Birth* $(S_1)$
* *Public hospital* $(S_2)$

The relationships between the variables are illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 1.
The prevalences of the variables, and strengths of dependencies between them,
are chosen to mimic real data and the assumed values for the sensitivity
parameters in @smith2019bounding. The simulated data mimics a cohort with 5000
observations, even though the original study is a case-control study. For more
details of the variables and the models, see @zetterstrom2023Rpackage.

![Figure 2. Causal model for the `zika_learner` dataset.](Figures/zikaDag.png){width=50%}

The causal dependencies are generated by the logit models described in Table 3. 

Table: Table 1. Data generating process for the dataset `zika_learner`. Models
generating causal dependencies are logistic, $g(X'\theta)$, for predictor
variable $X$ and model parameter $\theta$.

| Model                                 | Coefficients ($\theta$)/Proportions | Function argument    |
| :-----------------------------------: | :---------------------------------: | -------------------: |
| $P(V=1)$                              | $0.85$                              | `Vval`               |
| $P(U=1)$                              | $0.50$                              | `Uval`               |
| $P(T=1|V)=g(V'\theta_T)$              | $(-6.20,1.75)$                      | `Tcoef`              |
| $P(Y=1|T,U)=g[(T,U)'\theta_{Y}]$      | $(-5.20,5.00,-1.00)$                | `Ycoef`              |
| $P(S_1=1|T,U)=g[(V,U,T)'\theta_{S1}]$ | $(1.20,0.00,2.00,-4.00)$            | `Scoef`              |
| $P(S_2=1|T,U)=g[(V,U,T)'\theta_{S1}]$ | $(2.20,0.50,-2.75,0.00)$            | `Scoef`              |

The data was generated in `R`, version 4.2.0, using the package `arm`,
version 1.13-1, with the following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Seed.
set.seed(158118)

# Number of observations.
nObs = 5000

# The unmeasured variable, living area (V).
urban = rbinom(nObs, 1, 0.85)

# The treatment variable, zika.
zika_prob = arm::invlogit(-6.2 + 1.75 * urban)
zika = rbinom(nObs, 1, zika_prob)

# The unmeasured variable, SES (U).
SES = rbinom(nObs, 1, 0.5)

# The outcome variable, microcephaly.
mic_ceph_prob = arm::invlogit(-5.2 + 5 * zika - 1 * SES)
mic_ceph = rbinom(nObs, 1, mic_ceph_prob)

# The first selection variable, birth.
birth_prob = arm::invlogit(1.2 - 4 * zika + 2 * SES)
birth = rbinom(nObs, 1, birth_prob)

# The second selection variable, hospital.
hospital_prob = arm::invlogit(2.2 + 0.5 * urban - 2.75 * SES)
hospital = rbinom(nObs, 1, hospital_prob)

# The selection indicator.
sel_ind = birth * hospital
```
The resulting proportions of the `zika_learner` data, for the total dataset, the
subset with $S_1=1$ and the subset with $S_1=S_2=1$ are seen in Tables 2-4.

```{r echo = FALSE}
zika_learner2 = zika_learner

zika_learner2$zika = ifelse(zika_learner2$zika==1, "Zika infected", "Not zika infected")

table1::label(zika_learner2$mic_ceph) = "Microcephaly"
table1::label(zika_learner2$urban) = "Living area"
table1::label(zika_learner2$SES) = "SES"

my.render.cont <- function(x) {
  with(table1::stats.apply.rounding(table1::stats.default(x), digits=3, rounding.fn = table1::round_pad), c("",
                                                           "Mean "=sprintf("%s", MEAN)))
}

table1::table1(~ mic_ceph + urban + SES | zika, data=zika_learner2, render.continuous = my.render.cont,
           caption = "Table 2. Proportions for the simulated dataset, by treatment status and overall.")

zika_learner2 = subset(zika_learner2,zika_learner2$birth!=0)

table1::label(zika_learner2$mic_ceph) = "Microcephaly"
table1::label(zika_learner2$urban) = "Living area"
table1::label(zika_learner2$SES) = "SES"

table1::table1(~ mic_ceph + urban + SES | zika, data=zika_learner2, render.continuous = my.render.cont,
       caption = "Table 3. Proportions for the simulated dataset, by treatment status and overall, after the first selection.")

zika_learner2 = subset(zika_learner2,zika_learner2$sel_ind!=0)

table1::label(zika_learner2$mic_ceph) = "Microcephaly"
table1::label(zika_learner2$urban) = "Living area"
table1::label(zika_learner2$SES) = "SES"

table1::table1(~ mic_ceph + urban + SES | zika, data=zika_learner2, render.continuous = my.render.cont,
       caption = "Table 4. Proportions for the simulated dataset, by treatment status and overall, after both selections.")
```
The dataset and data generating process (DGP) can be used to test the functions
in `SelectionBias`.


## `sensitivityparametersM()`

The sensitivity parameters for the SV and GAF bounds are calculated for the 
generalized M-structure, illustrated in Figure 1. The sensitivity parameters are 
only calculated for an assumed model structure, since they depend on the 
unobserved variable, *U*. However, the observed probabilities of the outcome, 
$P(Y=1|T=t,I_S=1)$, $t=0,1$, are inputs as they are used to check if the causal 
estimand for the assumed DGP is greater or smaller than the observational 
estimand since the SV bound only is defined when the causal estimand is smaller 
than the observational estimand. If not, the treatment variable must be recoded. 
This is not an issue for the GAF bound since both a lower and upper bound is 
available. The code and the output are:
```{r eval = TRUE}
# SV bound
sensitivityparametersM(whichEst = "RR_tot",
                   whichBound = "SV",
                   Vval = matrix(c(1, 0, 0.85, 0.15), ncol = 2),
                   Uval = matrix(c(1, 0, 0.5, 0.5), ncol = 2),
                   Tcoef = c(-6.2, 1.75),
                   Ycoef = c(-5.2, 5.0, -1.0),
                   Scoef = matrix(c(1.2, 2.2, 0.0, 0.5,
                                    2.0, -2.75, -4.0, 0.0),
                                  ncol = 4),
                   Mmodel = "L",
                   pY1_T1_S1 = 0.286,
                   pY1_T0_S1 = 0.004)

# GAF bound
sensitivityparametersM(whichEst = "RR_tot",
                   whichBound = "GAF",
                   Vval = matrix(c(1, 0, 0.85, 0.15), ncol = 2),
                   Uval = matrix(c(1, 0, 0.5, 0.5), ncol = 2),
                   Tcoef = c(-6.2, 1.75),
                   Ycoef = c(-5.2, 5.0, -1.0),
                   Scoef = matrix(c(1.2, 2.2, 0.0, 0.5,
                                    2.0, -2.75, -4.0, 0.0),
                                  ncol = 4),
                   Mmodel = "L",
                   pY1_T1_S1 = 0.286,
                   pY1_T0_S1 = 0.004)
```
The first argument is `whichEst`, where the user inputs the causal estimand of
interest. It must be one of the four `"RR_tot"`, `"RD_tot"`, `"RR_sub"` or 
`"RD_sub"`. The second argument is `whichBound`, where the user inputs the bound
they want to use, either `"SV"` or `"GAF"`. Third, the argument `Vval` takes the
matrix for *V* as input. The first column contains the values that *V* can take,
and the second column contains the corresponding probabilities. In this example,
*V* is binary, so the first two elements in the matrix are 1 and 0. However, any
discrete *V* can be used. An approximation of a continuous *V* can be used, if
it is discretized. The fourth argument is `Uval`, which takes the matrix for *U*
as input. The matrix *U* has a similar structure as *V*. The fifth argument is
`Tcoef`, containing the coefficients used in the model for *T*. The first entry
in `Tcoef` is the intercept of the model, and the second the slope for *V*. The
sixth argument is `Ycoef`, containing the coefficient vector for the outcome
model, where the first entry is the intercept, the second the slope coefficient
for *T* and third is the slope coefficient for *U*. The seventh argument is
`Scoef`. `Scoef` is the coefficient matrix for the selection variables. The
number of rows is equal to the number of selection variables, and the number of
columns is equal to four. The columns represent the intercept, and slope
coefficients for *V*, *U* and *T*, respectively. A summary of the code notation
is seen in the last column of Table 3. The eighth argument is `Mmodel`, which
indicates whether the models in the M-structure are probit (`Mmodel = "P"`) or
logit (`Mmodel = "L"`). The ninth and tenth arguments are `pY1_T1_S1` and
`pY1_T0_S1`. They are the observed probabilities $P(Y=1|T=1,I_S=1)$ and
$P(Y=1|T=0,I_S=1)$. The output is the sensitivity parameters for the chosen 
bound and, for the SV bound, an indicator stating if the bias is negative and 
the coding for the treatment has been reversed.

In the zika example, the estimand of interest is the relative risk in the
total population, `whichEst = "RR_tot"`, the DGP is found in Table 1, logistic
models are used in the DGP and the probabilities are found in Table 4. For the
SV bound, the output is $RR_{UY|T=1}=2.71$, $RR_{UY|T=0}=1.94$, 
$RR_{SU|T=1}=1.80$, and $RR_{SU|T=0}=2.00$, which gives $BF_1=1.39$ and 
$BF_0=1.32$, and the treatment coding is reversed. For the GAF bound, the output
is $M_T=0.4502$ and $m_T=0.002$.

## `SVbound()`

The SV bound can be calculated using the function `SVbound()`. The first
argument is `whichEst`, indicating the causal estimand of interest (`"RR_tot"`,
`"RD_tot"`, `"RR_sub"` or `"RD_sub"`). The second and third arguments are the
observed conditional probabilities $P(Y=1|T=1,I_S=1)$ and $P(Y=1|T=0,I_S=1)$, 
which are needed to calculate bounds for the causal estimands and not the 
selection bias itself. The subsequent arguments are the sensitivity parameters
provided by the user. The default value for all sensitivity parameters are
`NULL`, and the user must then specify numeric values on the sensitivity
parameters that are necessary for the bound for the chosen estimand. The 
sensitivity parameters can either be calculated using the function
`sensitivityparametersM()`, or found elsewhere. For sensitivity parameters found
elsewhere, `SVbound()` is not restricted to the generalized M-structure. 
However, the necessary assumptions for the SV bound must still be fulfilled
[@smith2019bounding]. The output is the SV bound. The code and output are:
```{r eval = TRUE}
SVbound(whichEst = "RR_tot",
        pY1_T1_S1 = 0.004,
        pY1_T0_S1 = 0.286,
        RR_UY_T1 = 2.71,
        RR_UY_T0 = 1.94,
        RR_SU_T1 = 1.80,
        RR_SU_T0 = 2.00)
```
As before in the zika example, the causal estimand is the relative risk in the
subpopulation, `whichEst = "RR_tot"`. The sensitivity parameters are
$RR_{UY|T=1}=2.71$, $RR_{UY|T=0}=1.94$, $RR_{SU|T=1}=1.80$, and 
$RR_{SU|T=0}=2.00$, calculated above in `sensitivityparametersM()`, which gives 
an SV bound equal to 0.01. If the causal estimand is underestimated, the 
recoding of the treatment must be done manually.


## `SVboundsharp()`

The sharpness of an SV bound can be evaluated using `SVboundsharp()` 
[@zetterstrom2023Rpackage]. However, it is only bounds for the relative risk in 
the subpopulation that can be sharp. The first argument, `BF_U`, is the value of 
$BF_U$ which can be calculated using `sensitivityparametersM`. The second 
argument, `pY1_T0_S1`, is the probability $P(Y=1|T=0,I_S=1)$. The output is a 
string stating whether the SV bound is sharp or inconclusive. The code and 
output are:
```{r eval = TRUE}
SVboundsharp(BF_U = 1.56,
             pY1_T0_S1 = 0.27)
```
We are actually interested in bounds for the relative risk in the total 
population in the zika example but to demonstrate the function we check if the 
bound for the relative risk in the subpopulation is sharp. Thus, $BF_U=1.56$ 
and $P(Y=1|T=0,I_S=1)=0.27$ (calculated from `sensitivityparametersM()` and the
`zika_learner`). Note that if the causal estimand is underestimated, the 
recoding of the treatment has to be done manually. In this setting, the SV bound 
is sharp. As before, the bias is negative, and we have reversed the coding of 
the treatment.


## `AFbound()`

The AF bound is calculated using the function `AFbound()`. The first argument is
the causal estimand of interest (`"RR_tot"`, `"RD_tot"`, `"RR_sub"` or
`"RD_sub"`). The second argument is `outcome`, where the user inputs either the
observed numeric vector with the outcome variable or a vector with the
conditional outcome probabilities, $P(Y=1|T=1,I_S=1)$ and $P(Y=1|T=0,I_S=1)$.
The third argument is `treatment`, where the user inputs either the observed
numeric vector with the treatment variable or a vector with the conditional 
treatment probabilities, $P(T=1|I_S=1)$ and $P(T=0|I_S=1)$. The fourth argument
is `selection` where the user can either input the observed selection vector
or the selection probability. Its default value is `NULL` since it is only 
required when the causal estimands in the total population are of interest. If 
the subpopulation is of interest and `selection = NULL`, the outcome and
treatment vectors must only include the selected subjects. The output is the 
lower and upper AF bounds. The code and output are:
```{r eval = TRUE}
attach(zika_learner)

AFbound(whichEst = "RR_tot",
        outcome = mic_ceph[sel_ind == 1],
        treatment = zika[sel_ind == 1],
        selection = mean(sel_ind))
```
Similar to before, `whichEst = "RR_tot"`. Furthermore, the outcome and treatment
variables are microcephaly and zika. The selection probability is specified 
since the other variables are restricted to those subjects with $I_S=1$. The 
output is the lower and upper AF bounds, which are 0 and 454.09 in the zika example.

If the raw data is not available, one can input the conditional probabilities
instead. In this example, these probabilities are:
```{r eval = TRUE}
AFbound(whichEst = "RR_tot",
        outcome = c(0.286, 0.004),
        treatment = c(0.002, 0.998),
        selection = mean(sel_ind))
```
The difference in these two examples comes from rounding errors. Note that the
treatment does not need to be recoded since there is both a lower and upper
bound. Please have this in mind when comparing the bounds to the SV bound.


## `GAFbound()`

The GAF bound is calculated using the function `GAFbound()`. The first argument
is the causal estimand of interest (`"RR_tot"`, `"RD_tot"`, `"RR_sub"` or
`"RD_sub"`). The second and third arguments are `M` and `m` which are the two
sensitivity parameters for the GAF bound. The sensitivity parameters can either
be calculated using `sensitivityparametersM()`, or found elsewhere.
For sensitivity parameters found elsewhere, `GAFbound()` is not restricted to 
the generalized M-structure. However, the necessary assumptions for the GAF 
bound must still be fulfilled [@zetterstrom2024]. The fourth argument is 
`outcome`, where the user inputs either the observed numeric vector with the 
outcome variable or a vector with the conditional outcome probabilities, 
$P(Y=1|T=1,I_S=1)$ and $P(Y=1|T=0,I_S=1)$. The fifth argument is `treatment`, 
where the user inputs either the observed numeric vector with the treatment 
variable or a vector with the conditional treatment probabilities, 
$P(T=1|I_S=1)$ and $P(T=0|I_S=1)$. The sixth argument is `selection` where the 
user can either input the observed selection vector or selection probability. 
Its default value is `NULL` since it is only required when the causal estimands 
in the total population are of interest. If the subpopulation is of interest and 
`selection = NULL`, the outcome and treatment vectors must only include the 
selected subjects. The output is the lower and upper GAF bounds. The code and 
output are:
```{r eval = TRUE}
GAFbound(whichEst = "RR_tot",
         M = 0.4502,
         m = 0.002, 
         outcome = mic_ceph[sel_ind == 1],
         treatment = zika[sel_ind == 1],
         selection = mean(sel_ind))
```
Similar to before, `whichEst = "RR_tot"`. The sensitivity parameters are the 
output from `sensitivityparametersM()`. Furthermore, the outcome and treatment
variables are microcephaly and zika. The selection probability is specified 
since the other variables are restricted to those subjects with $I_S=1$. The 
output is the lower and upper GAF bounds, which are 0.01 and 147.42 in the 
zika example.

If the raw data is not available, one can input the conditional probabilities
instead, similar to the AF bound. Note that the treatment does not need to be
recoded since there is both a lower and upper bound. Please have this in mind
when comparing the bounds to the SV bound.


## `CAFbound()`

The CAF bound is calculated using the function `CAFbound()`. The first argument
is the causal estimand of interest (`"RR_tot"`, `"RD_tot"`, `"RR_sub"` or
`"RD_sub"`). The second and third arguments are `M` and `m` which are the two
sensitivity parameters for the CAF bound. The fourth argument is `outcome`,
where the user inputs either the observed numeric vector with the outcome
variable or a vector with the conditional outcome probabilities,
$P(Y=1|T=1,I_S=1)$ and $P(Y=1|T=0,I_S=1)$. The fifth argument is `treatment`,
where the user inputs either the observed numeric vector with the treatment
variable or a vector with the conditional treatment probabilities, 
$P(T=1|I_S=1)$ and $P(T=0|I_S=1)$. The sixth argument is `selection` where the
user can either input the observed selection vector or selection probability.
Its default value is `NULL` since it is only required when the causal estimands
in the total population are of interest. If the subpopulation is of interest and
`selection = NULL`, the outcome and treatment vectors must only include the
selected subjects. The output is the lower and upper CAF bounds. The code and
output are:
```{r eval = TRUE}
CAFbound(whichEst = "RR_tot",
         M = 0.3,
         m = 0.005, 
         outcome = c(0.286, 0.004),
         treatment = c(0.002, 0.998),
         selection = mean(sel_ind))
```
Similar to before, `whichEst = "RR_tot"`. The sensitivity parameters are chosen 
by the user. Furthermore, the outcome and treatment variables are microcephaly 
and zika. The selection probability is specified since other variables are 
restricted to those subjects with $I_S=1$. The output is the lower and upper 
CAF bounds, which are 0.04 and 67.78 in the zika example.

If the raw data is not available, one can input the conditional probabilities
instead, similar to the AF and GAF bounds. Note that the treatment does not need
to be recoded since there is both a lower and upper bound. Please have this in
mind when comparing the bounds to the SV bound.
