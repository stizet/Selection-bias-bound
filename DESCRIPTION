Description: Computes bounds and sensitivity parameters as part of sensitivity
    analysis for selection bias. Two bounds are provided: SV bound and AF bound.
    The SV bound assumes an additional dependence structure in form of a
    generalized M-structure (Smith and VanderWeeles, 2019) whereas the AF bound
    holds for general assumptions in the potential outcomes framework 
    (Zetterstrom and Waernbaum, 2022).
