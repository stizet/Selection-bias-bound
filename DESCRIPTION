Description: Calculates bounds and sensitivity parameters. The sensitivity 
    parameters is calculated for user specified parameters in the generalized
    M-structure. Smith and VanderWeeles (SV) bound is calculated for user
    specified sensitivity parameters. These can either come from the 
    generlized M-structure, or another souce. The sharpness of the SV bound can
    be assessed. The assumption free bound is calculated for observed data
    (outcome, treatment and selection variables).
