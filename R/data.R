#' Simulated data set emulating a zika outbreak in Brazil
#'
#' The data set is simulated to mimic real data. For the data generating
#' process, see the vignette.
#'
#' @usage data(zika_learner)
#'
#' @format A data frame with 5,000 observations on the following 7 binary
#'   variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{mic_ceph}{Indication if the baby has microcephaly (1=microcephaly, 0=not microcephaly)}
#'   \item{zika}{Indication if the mother is infected by zika (1=infected, 0=not infected)}
#'   \item{urban}{Indication of the living area of the subject (1=urban, 0=rural)}
#'   \item{SES}{Indication of the socioeconomic status of the subject (1=high, 0=low)}
#'   \item{birth}{First selection variable. Indication if the baby is born (1=birth, 0=terminated birth)}
#'   \item{hospital}{Second selection variable. Indication if the delivery is in a public hospital (1=public, 0=private)}
#'   \item{sel_ind}{Selection indicator variable. Indication if the subject is included in the study (1=included, 0=not included)}
#' }
#'
#' @details The data set is created to use in examples of selection bias. A
#'   similar example has previously been used in articles that construct bounds
#'   for selection bias (Smith and VanderWeele, 2019; Zetterstrom and Waernbaum,
#'   2022).
